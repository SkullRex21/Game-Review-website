        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Emma and i have been into gaming since the age of <b>eight</b>, i got a Nintendo DS for my birthday which introduced me to gaming and characters like <b>Mario</b> and <b>Sonic</b> and i still have my DS today.  
        In <b>2015</b> for Chrismas when i was <b>nine</b>, i got a PS4 which i was really happy by and i got into games like <b>Minecraft</b> and some of the lego games like <b>Marvel superheros</b> and <b>Jurassic world</b>.
        Over time i got to play games for 18+ like <b>GTA 5</b> and <b>The Last Of Us</b> and one day i got to play a game called <b>Days Gone</b> which become my favourite game.
        The reason why i picked these four games is because they are all storybased games which i like and two of them a decision based games, i didn't pick Days gone 
        even though i said it was favourite simply becasue i could talk about forever and make a whole website talking about that.</p>
