        <p> <b>Norman</b>is one of the main characters you play as, he is a <b>FBI agent</b> and he is sent to the police force,<br>
        to help with the investigation of the <b>Origami Killer</b>. He has a device called ARI (Added Reality Interface), which are glasses to help him in the crime scenes and look at evidence.<br>
        He is sent by the FBI headquarters in Washington D.C to help with the case, he also has a degree in criminal psychology.<br>
        His main concern is saving <b>Shaun Mars</b> and trying to find the Origami Killer, he is paired up with <b>Carter Blake</b> who is a police lieutenant,<br>
        Blake is very closed-minded and is very sure that Ethan is the Origami Killer this creates tension between him and Norman.<br></p>
