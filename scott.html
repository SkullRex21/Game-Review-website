        <p>Scott is one of the main characters you play as, he is a former marine and police lieutenant, he became a private investigator when he retired.<br>
        During the game his goal is to find evidence about the Origami Killer, Scott meets Lauren Winter whose son is one of the victims of the Origami Killer, they work together and try to find the killer.<br>
        Scott didn't have the best childhood, he had a drunken and abusive father who often threw him and his brother out of their tralier.<br>
        At some point in his life he got taken away to a foster home where he got adopted by the Shelby family, who were much better than his father.<br>
        In his adult years he became a US marine and then an officer at the local police force (the same one that Norman goes to).<br>
        He works his way up to lieutenant and retires after twenty years and decides to become a private investigator.<br></p>
