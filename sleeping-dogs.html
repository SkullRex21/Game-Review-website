        <h1>The description of the game</h1>
        <p>The game is made by United Front Games and was published by Square Enix, it was released for PS3 and Xbox 360 in August 2012.</p>
        <p>The game is about you play as Wei Shen who is an uncover police officer and it is set in Hong Kong, he is trying to get in with a local gang called Sun On Yee.<br>
        He meets his childhood friend Jackie Ma who introduces Wei to the gang, there he meets the leader Winston Chu who lets Wei joins them.<br>
        There is also a rival gang called Jade Gang and their leader is Sam Lin who goes by Dogeyes, he used to be part of the Sun On Yee.</p>
        
        <p>Wei Shen is the main character and who you play as, he is an undercover police officer and was born in Hong Kong but he moved to San Francisco at the age of 10.<br>
        He then joined the SFPD after high school and graduated at the top of his class, we are not sure when he moved back to Hong Kong but after he moved back he started his undercover operation.<br>
        Later on he gets re-introduced to his childhood friend Jackie Ma, who introduces him to the Sun On Yee the gang who he has to infiltrate, there he meets Winston Chu who is the leader and Wei starts working for them.<br>
        Jackie Ma is one of the main side characters who you meet early on in the game, he as been part of many gangs since he was a kid but he was often used as a errand boy.<br>
        Jackie becomes more inportant when Wei joins and the two of them work together, the both of them do work for Winston and help him on finding something/someone for most of the game.<br>
        Winston Chu is one of the main side characters in the game and is the leader of Sun Of Yee, for most of his childhood he grew up near many Sun On Yee members including Sam (Dogeyes) Lin both of them were once good friends.<br>
        Winston started to work for the Sun On Yee at a young age because he hated school and didn't like learning, he worked his way up to the top and now he controls North Point and helps people that need something taken care of.<br>
        Sam Lin who goes by dogeyes is the main antagonist in the game and the leader of the Jade Gang, growing up he didn't have the best childhood his mum died and his dad was abusive but he met Winston and the two of them became best friends.<br>
        Winston's mum also looked out for him and gave him meals at her house and let him stay over, he also dated Mimi Shen (Wei's sister) but Wei didn't like them dating he didn't trust Sam and he stabbed him with a pen for hanging out with his sister too much.</p>

        <h2>The development of the game</h2>
        <p>In 2007 Activision started making a new True Crime game this one going to be set in Hong Kong, but after two years working on it they cancelled it on February 9th 2011.<br>
        It was due to competition from other titles like GTA and Red Dead Redemption and Activision said it was not that level of quality like those games.<br>
        August 2011 Square Enix acquired the rights to the game and renamed it to Sleeping Dogs and it was released on August 14th 2012.<br>
        In the UK Sleeping Dogs was the best selling game in the week of its release and was fifth highest first week sales of any game released in 2012.<br>
        By the end of September 2012 it had sold 1.5 million untis, but it didn't meet sales expectations and was considered to be a failure.</p>
